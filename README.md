# Speech-Signal-Processing

Purpose:

Assignments in Speech Signal Processing, based on Matlab. Learn methods of endpoint detection, pitch detection, LPC feature detection, MFCC feature detection, and speech recognition.

Solution:

Combine short-time zero-crossing rate and the short-time energy method to detect endpoinds.
Use autocorrelation funtion to realize pitch detection.
Combine linear prediction coefficient analysis and short-time autocorrelation function to detect LPC feature. 
Calculate the MFCC parameters to realize MFCC feature detection.
Combine endpoint detection, pitch detection, LPC and MFCC feature to realize recognition.
